# Migration to v6

## Migration of deprecated paused key

If you have paused queues after upgrading to this version. You must use **migrateDeprecatedPausedKey** from your queue instances in order to move your jobs from this state to wait state.

Paused key is not longer needed as this state is already represented by queue meta key. It also improve the process of pausing or resuming a queue as we don't need to rename any key.

## Remove legacy markers

When migrating from versions before v5, you must use **removeLegacyMarkers** method from queue your queue instances. 

It's recommended to do this process:

1. Pause your queues.
2. Upgrade to v6.
3. Execute **removeLegacyMarkers** in each queue.
4. Resume your queues.

This way you will prevent that your workers pick a legacy marker.

A second option would be to do incremental upgrades.
