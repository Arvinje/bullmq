# Migration to v6

## Migration of deprecated paused key

If you have paused queues after upgrading to this version. These jobs will be moved to wait state when initializing any of our instances (Worker, Queue, QueueEvents or FlowProducer).

Paused key is not longer needed as this state is already represented by queue meta key. It also improve the process of pausing or resuming a queue as we don't need to rename any key.

## Remove legacy markers

When migrating from versions before v5.
It's recommended to do this process:

1. Pause your queues.
2. Upgrade to v6.
3. Instantiate any instance where migrations will be executed.
4. Resume your queues.

This way you will prevent that your workers pick a legacy marker.

A second option would be to do incremental upgrades.
